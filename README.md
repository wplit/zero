This theme only serves as a placeholder for sites built with [Zion Builder Pro](https://zionbuilder.io/?ref=extras). 

There's no CSS or JS added on the front end from the theme at all. It just adds the very basic theme supports such as featured images, activating the WP menus etc.

Note - this is not a starter theme, there are no templates at all. It's sole purpose is just if you're just needing a blank page as a starting point and every template is going to be generated by Zion Builder Pro. When you activate the page will be completely blank, waiting for you to add your first Zion Builder template.

## This 'Zero Theme' solves a few basic problems..

1. No more theme update notifications (assuming this is the only theme installed)
2. No conflicting CSS classes from themes when using Zion Builder
3. Adds a few necessary theme features such enabling WP menus, features images, HTML5 markup.
