# Zero Theme for Zion Builder Pro
**Contributors:** David Browne

**License:** GPLv2 or later  
**License URI:** http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html

This theme only serves as a placeholder for sites built with [Zion Builder Pro](https://zionbuilder.io/?ref=extras).

There's no CSS or JS added on the front end at all. It just adds the very basic theme supports such as featured images, activating the WP menus, allowing wide block styles etc.

## This 'Zero Theme' solves two problems..

1. No more theme update notifications (assuming this is the only theme installed)
2. No conflicting CSS classes from themes when using Zion Builder (looking at you Hello theme)
